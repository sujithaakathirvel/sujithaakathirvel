## Hi there 👋
Currently pursuing **MSc Computing** at UEL, exploring **Cloud & DevOps** — especially AWS.  

☁️ Currently learning how cloud technologies make software faster, scalable, and easier to manage.  

🧩 I enjoy figuring out how things connect in the cloud and documenting what I learn.  

🚀 Recent projects:  
- 🪶 **Serverless To-Do App** – built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway & DynamoDB  
- 🐳 **Containerized To-Do App** – deployed using Docker & AWS ECS Fargate
